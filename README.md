Welcome, visitors.
I'm a vanilla-holic code writer.
In recent one decade, I'm specially excited on the Javascript, HTML, Css and their co-existance.
If you get a something you needed, it makes me very excited.

In my thought, there is no reason to contact with me.
But when it is needed, visit my homepage ( http://isitea.net ) and leave a comment.
